CpG Islands are important because they represent areas of the 
         genome that have for some reason been protected from the mutating 
         properties of methylation through evolutionary time (which tend to 
         change the G in CpG pairs to an A). Often, they point to the presence 
         of an important piece of intergenic DNA, such as that found in the 
         promoter regions of genes where transcription factors bind. . In cancers, 
         loss of expression of genes occurs about 10 times more frequently by hypermethylation
         of promoter CpG islands than by mutations.
