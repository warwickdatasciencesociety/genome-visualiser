A single nucleotide polymorphism (SnP) is the most common type of genetic variation between people. They occur on average once in every 1000 nucleotides (Roughly 4 million SnPs in total). As an example, a SNP may replace the nucleotide cytosine (C) with the nucleotide thymine (T) in a certain stretch of DNA. They can act as biological markers which help locate genes that are related to diseases. When SnPs occur with in or near a gene they may play a role in the disease by affecting the genes function.
